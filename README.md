# Linear Regression Project 1

This project involves building a simple linear regression model to predict sales based on advertising budgets across different media channels (TV, Radio, Newspaper). The goal is to explore the relationship between the advertising budget and sales, and to build a predictive model using TV advertising data.

## Project Overview

This project follows these steps:

1. **Data Inspection**: Load and inspect the data for basic statistics and structure.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Identify and handle missing values, if any.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the data to understand relationships between variables.
4. **Model Building**: Build a linear regression model to predict sales based on TV advertising budgets.
5. **Saving and Testing the Model**: Save the trained model and test it using a web service.
